# Offline Myths
*A breathing statue beyond other people’s stories.*

**Offline Myths** is a p5.js WEBGL sketch about evolving past the labels placed on you.  
A grayscale statue floats inside a niche. On each slow “breath,” a subset of voxels
spikes outward and settles—like a body testing new ranges. Behind it, a curved band of
multilingual, tongue-in-cheek **MEDIA OFFLINE / ASSET NOT FOUND** messages wraps the space:
glitchy metadata that once defined the file. The piece sits between archive and aliveness.

# Controls / Interaction

- Drag: orbit the camera (orbitControl)

- The arch gently swings; the text band sits behind the statue

- The statue breathes—spikes ease in/out (smoothed, non-strobing)

# Concept

- The statue renders twice: once intact (textured plane) and once as a voxel cloud.

- Spike length is driven by a smoothed “breath” and edge contrast, so the 3D form reads.

- The curved text band parodies Media Offline alerts—in multiple languages—standing in for
other people’s myths. The work is about relinking authenticity without erasing history.
